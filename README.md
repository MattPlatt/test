# Object Detection and Instance Segmentation for converting Images to SysML 2.0

## Problem Statement

This project focuses on creating and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) utilizing instance segmentation and object detection to automatically read and convert Systems Engineering Diagrams into a portable and reusable format for disparate systems, with a primary application in SysML 2.0. The initial focus is specifically on cable block diagrams and their associated engineering standards, ensuring the process aligns with established guidelines for accuracy and consistency. However, the methodology is designed to be adaptable, meaning that if successful, it could be extended to other types of engineering models, such as electrical schematics, piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs), and mechanical layouts. This flexibility highlights the broader potential of the approach, offering a scalable solution to streamline data extraction and integration across various standardized formats, ultimately enhancing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) workflows.

The training process involves the generation of synthetic datasets using Python scripts that programmatically create cable block diagrams and annotate them dynamically. This approach ensures a diverse and extensive dataset, reducing the dependency on labor-intensive manual labeling while enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to generalize. By employing iterative training and validation, the AI refines its understanding of the diagram elements, ensuring high accuracy and adaptability. Furthermore, the modularity of the AI framework allows for future extensions to recognize components in other diagram types, making it a scalable and versatile solution for engineering design and data interoperability.

## Overview

This project automates the creation, annotation, and preprocessing of training data for AI models focused on detecting block diagram blocks, cables, connectors, and other classes that are standardized. Due to exponential complication, many classes have been ommited in the interim to establish a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) to proof the concept. The system addresses the complexity of structured data layouts and prepares high-quality datasets for training object detection and instance segmentation models.

## Training the Models

The system is divided into several modules and workflows, outlined below:

### 1. **Image Generation**
- **Randomized Diagram Creation**: Automatically generate synthetic images containing randomly placed blocks, connectors, and cables using Python's PIL library and custom scripts.
- **Customizable Blocks and Connectors**: The system allows flexibility in the number, size, and placement of blocks and connectors, ensuring varied training data.
- **Cable Routing and Annotation**: Includes logic to connect blocks with dashed cables and annotate them with YOLO-compliant labels.

### 2. **Label Generation**
- **YOLO Format Labels**: Each generated image includes corresponding YOLO labels for object detection tasks. Labels are normalized and stored in .txt files.
- **Custom Class Definitions**: The system supports multiple object classes such as blocks, connectors, cables, and group boxes.

### 3. **Image Slicing**
- **Slicing with Overlap**: Generated images are sliced into smaller patches with a configurable overlap (e.g., 25%) for training efficiency. 
- **Label Adjustment**: Sliced images include adjusted bounding boxes to ensure labels are correctly aligned with the new coordinates of each slice.

### 4. **Dataset Conversion**
- **YOLO to JSON Conversion**: YOLO annotations are converted to COCO-style JSON format for use with Detectron2's instance segmentation and object detection models.
- **Segmentation Masks**: The system generates masks for cables, blocks, and connectors, supporting instance segmentation tasks.

### 5. **Cable-Specific Training**
- **Focused Cable Detection**: A dedicated dataset and model are created exclusively for cables due to their complexity. This model focuses on detecting cables independently of other objects.

### 6. **Comprehensive Model Training**
- **Other Object Detection**: The remaining images, which include blocks and connectors, are processed and used to train another model to handle these objects.
- **Separate and Combined Models**: The pipeline is modular, allowing separate models for cables and other objects or a combined detection approach.

## Key Features
- **Randomized Diagram Variability**: Generate diverse images with customizable block, connector, and cable configurations.
- **Scalable Annotation System**: Supports thousands of images and labels for large-scale dataset creation.
- **Instance Segmentation Ready**: Prepares data for advanced segmentation models like Detectron2.

## Workflow Steps for development and training

1. **Image Generation**:Utilizing Python and PIL create randamized cable block diagram images.
2. **Label Generation and Conversion**: Initially experiment with YOLO; transition to Faster R-CNN ResNet 101, requiring MASK formatting in JSON.![diagram_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6a64c40-31bc-42ab-bf55-af9d363d7ae6)![diagram_10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c05865ab-bac6-43f1-a15c-209594104a63)


3. **Image Slicing**: Slice each image with a 25% overlap for enhanced training efficiency.![sliced_image_with_boxes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81e08538-b805-4cf8-b73f-8a7f1a746e16)
7 **Run ResNet 101 on full size image**: Use saved weights to predict and save results in JSON format.
8. **Run ResNet 101 on sliced images with custom settings**: Slice images, run predictions on slices, and adjust bounding box coordinates for the original file.
9. **Combine Predictions**: Merge predictions from both diagram types into a unified COCO JSON format for implementation
10. **Display Predictions**: Visualize combined predictions on the original image for validation.![diagram_8001_annotated (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54cf18c3-ee87-4591-8082-3b302b400358)

11. **Run Object Character Recognition (OCR) to capture the location and content of written text within the image.
12. **SysML Conversion**: Convert JSON predictions and OCR into SysMLv2 using custom logic.
13. **Export SysMLv2 File**: Output the final SysMLv2 representation for engineering use utlizing finalized predictions file and captured OCR.
